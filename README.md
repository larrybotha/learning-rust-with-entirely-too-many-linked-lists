# Learning Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists

Annotations and learning from https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/

- [A Bad Stack](./docs/02-a-bad-stack.md)
- [An Ok Stack](./docs/03-an-ok-stack.md)
- [A Persistent Stack](./docs/04-a-persistent-stack.md)
- [A Bad Safe Deque](./docs/05-a-bad-safe-deque.md)
- [An Ok Unsafe Queue](./docs/06-an-ok-unsafe-queue.md)

NOTE: I've only gone as far as the pre-unsafe implementations - learning about
raw pointers and unsafe Rust is not valuable to me at this point in time
